# Welcome to Pic Puller for Craft.

## Update: This Plug-in will no longer work because the Instagram API has removed access to the *popular* image feed.

Take a look at documentation, PPfC_docs_v1.md, which should be next to this file in the directory.

See the plug in in action here:

This is still BETA software. 

I've got an updated version in testing currently for the full (i.e. paid) version of Pic Puller for Craft. It includes a fieldtype which allows authorized users to browse from the Instagram feed. It also has a tag search built into the fieldtype. It is compatible with a Matrix field type as well.  It's getting very positive feedback from beta testers.

Cheers.
